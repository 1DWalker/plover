{"name":"Plover","tagline":"Open source stenotype engine","body":"Copyright (c) 2010-2011 Joshua Harlan Lifton.\r\nSee LICENSE.txt for details.\r\n\r\nPlover: Open Source Stenography Software\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nStenography expertise, original concept, feature design, and testing\r\nby Mirabai Knight. Code and technical design by Joshua Harlan\r\nLifton. Additional code contributions by Hesky Fisher.\r\n\r\nSupported stenotype protocols:\r\n * QWERTY keyboards with n-key rollover (e.g. Microsoft SideWinder X4)\r\n * Gemini PR (a.k.a. Gemini Enhanced)\r\n * TX Bolt (a.k.a. Gemini TX)\r\n * Stentura\r\n * Treal\r\n * Passport\r\n\r\nContact the authors if you would like Plover to support your stenotype\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlover is not mature software. Once running, it will interpret all\r\nkeystrokes according to the stenography dictionary you provide. Be\r\ncareful what you type. When using the Sidewinder or any other normal\r\nkeyboard with Plover, your normal keyboard shortcuts may not work. Use\r\nthe mouse or stop the Plover program if you are unsure of what will\r\nresult from typing.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\nPlover is available for Windows as a compiled executable. The latest \r\nversion is here: https://github.com/plover/plover/releases/download/v2.5.6/plover.exe\r\nThere is no installer, just run the binary \r\n\r\nMac:\r\nPlover is available for Mac OSX as an app. Download the dmg from:\r\nhttps://github.com/plover/plover/releases/download/v2.5.6/Plover.dmg\r\nOpen the dmg and drag plover to the applications folder to install.\r\nBefore running the application you will also need to \r\nOpen System Preferences, Open \"Universal Access\" and check the box next \r\nto \"Enable access for assistive devices\" If you do not do this, Plover \r\nwill not work.\r\n\r\nLinux (debian/ubuntu):\r\nThere is no package yet so an installation requires installing all dependencies. First, you must have python 2.7. Then\r\nrun the following commands::\r\n\r\n    cd\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-xlib python-wxgtk2.8 wmctrl python-dev python-pip\r\n    sudo pip install -U appdirs simplejson pyserial\r\n    wget https://github.com/plover/plover/archive/v2.5.6.tar.gz\r\n    tar -zxf v2.5.6.tar.gz\r\n    cd plover-2.5.6\r\n    sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\nOnce this is done then you should be able to run plover from the applications menu or from the command line with::\r\n\r\n    /usr/local/bin/plover\r\n    \r\nIf you run into any trouble please seek help on the plover aviary: http://stenoknight.com/plover/aviary/phpBB3/\r\nor the plover mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ploversteno\r\n\r\nMore information is available at the Plover Wiki: http://stenoknight.com/wiki/Main_Page and the Plover Blog:  http://plover.stenoknight.com/\r\n\r\nRunning Plover\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\nRun the downloaded executable.\r\n\r\nMac:\r\nRun plover from applications.\r\n\r\nLinux:\r\nRun plover from the application list or the command line as shown above.\r\n\r\nAll OS:\r\nStarting the application will bring up a small window with a red\r\n'P' icon. At this point, Plover is inactive. To activate Plover, click\r\nthe red 'P' icon, or type on the steno machine the strokes\r\ncorresponding to the PLOVER:TOGGLE or PLOVER:RESUME commands as\r\ndefined in the dictionary. The icon will turn green to indicate that\r\nPlover is active and ready to translate stenography keystrokes into\r\nEnglish text. Clicking the green icon or sending the PLOVER:SUSPEND or\r\nPLOVER:TOGGLE commands will cause the icon to turn red, which means\r\nPlover is again in the inactive state.\r\n","google":"UA-42897347-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
